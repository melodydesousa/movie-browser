# Fleet case study
Welcome to my case study! 
1. Download this project on your computer and go inside the folder on your terminal 

2. Open your terminal and check if "node" is installed on your computer with the command `node -v`<br>
You should see the version of the package installed ex: `v20.2.0`<br>
If not, please click on https://nodejs.org/en/download and follow the steps to install it

3. Launch `npm install` in your terminal

4. Launch `npm start`

5. A window will open automatically. If not, go on http://localhost:3000/

Enjoy! You will be able to search for a movie by its title or its alternative title, genre and year of release.
